# AI-Driven Venture Insights Dashboard

Built an autonomous AI agent and analytics dashboard that maps the portfolio activity of 10 top-tier VC firms. The system ingests and analyzes portfolio companies from elite funds, extracts real-time signals (hiring, product launches, fundraising cadence, category expansion), and identifies cross-portfolio patterns that reveal where leading investors are allocating time, talent, and capital.

Using Supabase as the data backbone, the agent enriches every company with sector embeddings, growth markers, and inferred momentum. The dashboard visualizes emerging themes, shared bets across firms, whitespace opportunities, and early signals of breakout companies.
